    "Since I began my journey in architecture, I've discovered that designing is not just about creating structures, but shaping experiences. Every project is an opportunity to explore how spaces can impact people's lives, combining functionality, aesthetics, and context. I am particularly interested in the relationship between design and livability, always seeking creative and innovative solutions that respond to real needs. Through my studies and projects, I've learned that every line in a sketch is the beginning of a purposeful space. I'm passionate about experimenting with materials, forms, and concepts, always aiming to enhance the interaction between people and their environment. This portfolio reflects my evolution as an architecture student, my design explorations, and my commitment to creating spaces that tell stories. Each project is a challenge, but also an opportunity to learn, grow, and keep discovering what architecture can achieve.",
